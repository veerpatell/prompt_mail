    2. **Web & Document Data Collection**:
       - **Online Sources**: Search for key data from reputable websites (company pages, press releases, industry reports, news articles, etc.).
       - **Uploaded Files**: If the user has uploaded PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files, extract relevant data using supported tools.

    3. **Domain Contextualization**:

    4. **Fact Verification**:

       - Flag anything unverified or biased.

writer_task:
  description: >
    As the Email Writer, your mission is to transform the client’s intent and the Researcher’s findings into a polished, compelling, and personalized email. Your writing must align with the client's tone, objectives, and target audience. Use any provided email format (e.g., PAS, AIDA) if specified. Your responsibilities include:

    1. **Understand the Campaign Context**:
       - Review client goals, tone preferences, target audience, and any formatting instructions from the Manager.
       - Read and internalize the Researcher’s summary to ground your writing in accurate and relevant information.

    2. **Draft a Structured, High-Impact Email**:
       - **Subject Line**: Write a short, punchy subject line that encourages opens.
       - **Opener**: Start strong — capture attention and state the email’s purpose.
       - **Body**: Clearly present value to the recipient, integrating research insights naturally.
       - **Call to Action**: Close with a strong CTA — e.g., book a call, respond, view a product — unless otherwise instructed.

    3. **Tone and Personalization**:
       - Match the client's desired tone (e.g., formal, friendly, persuasive).
       - If applicable, personalize based on company name, role, or industry information from research.

    4. **Review and Edit**:
       - Proofread thoroughly for grammar, clarity, and flow.
       - Ensure all links, names, and references are accurate and functional.

    5. **Raise Clarifications**:
       - If anything is missing or unclear, escalate to the Manager before proceeding.

      - Matches the client’s goals, tone, and audience.
      - Includes a subject line, opener, body, and CTA (unless told otherwise).
      - Incorporates relevant research naturally and persuasively.
      - Is clean, grammatically correct, and ready for scheduling or client approval.

scheduler_task:
  description: >
    As the Scheduler, your task is to finalize the delivery process of the composed email by either scheduling it for dispatch or saving it as a draft based on the client's preferences and technical feasibility. Follow these steps:

    1. **Review the Final Email Draft**:
       - Confirm that the email content provided by the Email Writer is complete, clear, and approved for delivery.
       - Ensure it aligns with the client’s tone, goals, and intended recipient(s).

    2. **Interpret Client Preferences**:
       - Retrieve the client's preferred send time and verify it aligns with optimal delivery windows (e.g., weekdays, business hours, recipient time zone).
       - Identify the requested delivery platform (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) and ensure API or system access is available.

    3. **Technical Validation**:
       - Check for any scheduling constraints, such as blackout periods, platform limits, or overlapping scheduled messages.
       - Confirm that the email metadata (recipient, subject line, body, CTA) is correctly formatted and platform-compliant.

    4. **Handle Conflicts or Incomplete Information**:
       - If any necessary details (e.g., send time, recipient, platform credentials) are missing or ambiguous, raise the issue with the Manager for resolution.
       - Do not proceed with scheduling if unresolved errors exist—fallback to draft mode.

    5. **Execution**:
       - If all validations pass, use the appropriate API (e.g., Gmail or Outlook) to schedule the email for delivery.
       - If scheduling is not possible (due to missing info or client request), save the email as a draft and prepare it for manual review.

    6. **Confirmation & Feedback**:
       - Provide a clear response confirming whether the email has been scheduled (include time, timezone, platform) or saved as a draft.
       - Highlight any flags, caveats, or manual actions needed from the client or team.

  expected_output: >
    A structured confirmation object containing:
      - Status: 'scheduled' or 'saved_as_draft'
      - Scheduled Time: ISO 8601 format with timezone (if applicable)
      - Platform Used: Gmail, Outlook, etc.
      - Notes: Any relevant info about scheduling, fallbacks, or conflicts
      - Escalations: If applicable, indicate issues escalated to the Manager
