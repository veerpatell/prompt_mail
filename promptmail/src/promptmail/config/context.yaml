  What is Generalist AI?
  Generalist AI is building general-purpose robotic intelligence ‚Äî AI systems that move beyond rigid programming and adapt fluidly like humans. These systems power robotic hands and embodied agents capable of performing diverse tasks across sectors ‚Äî without retraining for each new use case.

  Think of it as bringing GPT-like generalization to the physical world.

  How Does Generalist AI Work?
  We build robotic intelligence by combining-

  Human Demonstration - High-quality physical task data is collected by operators wearing robotic gloves ("AI Data Generalists").

  Multi-Task Learning - Using imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and large neural networks to build adaptable policies.

  Real-World Variability - Training on diverse tasks, object types, surfaces, and orientations to ensure transferability.

  üõ†Ô∏è What Tasks Are We Training Robots To Do?
  Our robotic agents are learning to watch humans do something ‚Äî and then do it themselves. Current task domains include-

  Pick-and-Place Operations - Moving objects of varied size, shape, and weight

  Tool Use - Operating screwdrivers, scissors, or other hand tools

  Assembly Tasks - Precise combination of components

  Unstructured Manipulation - Opening jars, folding clothing, flipping switches

  Fine Motor Control - Typing, zipping, buttoning, stacking with precision

  The ultimate goal - learn once, perform in many environments.

 What Can We Offer to Clients?
  We‚Äôre not selling a boxed product ‚Äî but we are partnering strategically with forward-thinking companies who want a front-row seat to the next era of robotics.

  üåü Why Generalist AI?
  Foundation Models for Robotics
  We‚Äôre building the "GPT-4 of physical tasks" ‚Äî one model, many capabilities.

  Scalable Data Engine
  Most robotics startups struggle with data. We‚Äôve solved that with a high-throughput system for demonstration capture, labeling, and model training.

  Human-Level Dexterity
  Our robots are trained using actual human control ‚Äî from gloves, sensors, and direct teleoperation.

  Real-World Iteration Speed
  We don‚Äôt live in simulations. Our systems improve daily from hands-on testing and real-world failures.

  üîß What Tasks Are We Currently Training On?
  Our current focus is on collecting data and training models for dexterous, multi-step manipulation tasks that require human-like coordination and adaptability. These include -

  Packing -

  Placing a bento box into a backpack ‚Äî a constrained spatial task that involves orientation control, insertion precision, and soft object handling.

  Zipping the backpack ‚Äî coordinating both hands (or multiple actuators), managing tension, and detecting completion of closure.

  Fine-Motor Disassembly and Sorting -

  Breaking down LEGO structures ‚Äî using the right amount of force and grip positioning to separate components cleanly.

  Sorting LEGO pieces ‚Äî categorizing by shape or size, requiring visual understanding, object differentiation, and precision placement.

  These tasks represent foundational building blocks for real-world generalist behavior ‚Äî combining spatial reasoning, tool interaction, and tactile precision. The objective is to train once and generalize to many similar real-world workflows (e.g., packing kits, organizing components, or handling consumer products).
